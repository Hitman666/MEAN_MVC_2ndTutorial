MEAN_MVC_2ndTutorial
====================

Code acompanying the [second blog post](https://hackhands.com/delving-node-js-express-web-framework/) (first one is [here](https://hackhands.com/how-to-get-started-on-the-mean-stack/)) in a series of posts which will teach you how to take advantage of the MEAN stack in becoming a full-stack JavaScript developer.

**Extra extra, read all about it:** You can get the blog2book (all posts in one nice PDF file) [via LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/meantodo) (yes, you can choose zero as the amount and I promise I won't take it against you, though a coffee would be nice ;)).

[Fourth blog post](https://hackhands.com/finishing-Angular-TODO-application-deploying-production/) is all about Angular and deploying to production.
[Third blog post](https://hackhands.com/mongodb-crud-mvc-way-with-passport-authentication/) is all about MongoDB.
[First blog post](https://hackhands.com/how-to-get-started-on-the-mean-stack/) was about getting started on the MEAN stack.
